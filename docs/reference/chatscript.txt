23/01/2025, 20:33 - Honey AI Chatbot: Family planning contributes significantly to maternal health by allowing women to space and limit pregnancies, which reduces the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. By preventing unintended pregnancies, family planning helps women avoid high-risk pregnancies and provides them with the opportunity to recover fully between pregnancies.

23/01/2025, 20:35 - Honey AI Chatbot: The withdrawal method, also known as "pulling out," is not considered a highly reliable form of contraception. It requires the male partner to withdraw before ejaculation, which can be difficult to time perfectly. Even with perfect use, the withdrawal method has a failure rate of about 4%, meaning 4 out of 100 couples will experience an unintended pregnancy in a year. With typical use, the failure rate increases to around 22%. Therefore, it is less effective than other contraceptive methods, such as condoms or birth control pills.
23/01/2025, 20:36 - Tobi Shalom: Are there natural supplements to help with conception?
23/01/2025, 20:36 - Honey AI Chatbot: While there are no guaranteed natural supplements to aid conception, some people believe that certain vitamins and minerals can support reproductive health. For example, folic acid, vitamin D, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids are often recommended for their potential benefits in supporting fertility. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, as they can provide personalized advice based on your health needs.

Generally, you would schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your options and have the IUD inserted. The IUD can be inserted at any time during your menstrual cycle, but your doctor might recommend a specific timing to ensure continuous contraceptive coverage. Once the IUD is inserted, you can stop taking the pills. Your healthcare provider will guide you through the process and address any concerns you may have.

This can vary for each person, but many women can conceive soon after stopping the pill. It's a good idea to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, and consider taking prenatal vitamins.

Hormonal contraceptives, like birth control pills, may lead to changes in libido for some individuals. However, others may not experience any change or might even notice an increase in desire due to reduced anxiety about unintended pregnancy. If you notice significant changes in your sexual desire after starting a contraceptive, it's a good idea to discuss this with a healthcare provider to explore other options that might better suit your needs.

This is often referred to as "dual protection." For example, combining a hormonal method like the pill with a barrier method like condoms can increase effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and also protect against STIs. It's important to choose methods that complement each other and suit your lifestyle and health needs. Consulting with a healthcare provider can help you make the best choice for your situation.

It's not advisable to use emergency contraception more than three times in a month, as it is meant for occasional use and not as a regular contraceptive method. Frequent use may also reduce its effectiveness and is not a substitute for regular contraceptive methods.

06/02/2025, 18:32 - Tobi Shalom: What are the side effects of postpill and If for instance, I'm ovulating and I have sex and I use the postpill, isn't it to stop the ovulation from coming, like my first day of ovulation or what?
06/02/2025, 18:32 - Honey AI Chatbot: Postpill is an emergency contraceptive that should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex, ideally within 24 to 72 hours. One of the side effects of using Postpill is irregularities in your menstrual cycle, such as delayed or early menstruation. You might also experience slight headaches, nausea, or breast tenderness. If you are ovulating, it is advisable to take it before sex, as it can delay ovulation. However, if you do not take it immediately after unprotected sex, there is a risk of pregnancy.

07/02/2025, 10:11 - Tobi Shalom: Can I use Postpill everyday?
07/02/2025, 10:11 - Honey AI Chatbot: No, you cannot use Postpill every day. It is a one-time emergency contraception pill meant to be taken only after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. It should not be taken more than three times in a month. For regular contraception, consider other methods that are designed for daily use.

07/02/2025, 10:14 - Honey AI Chatbot: I want you to know that one of the things to expect after taking Postpill is changes in the menstrual cycle. Your period might come earlier or it might be late. It all depends on your body system. If you're concerned or if your period is significantly delayed, it might be a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for further advice.

07/02/2025, 10:14 - Honey AI Chatbot: Taking Postpill frequently is not recommended. It is an emergency contraceptive meant to be used only as needed after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure, and should not be taken more than three times in a month. Frequent use can lead to side effects such as menstrual irregularities and is not a substitute for regular contraceptive methods. If you find yourself needing emergency contraception often, it might be a good idea to consider a more consistent form of birth control.

07/02/2025, 10:16 - Honey AI Chatbot: If you took the Postpill on the same day as having unprotected sex, it should be effective in preventing pregnancy. Postpill is an emergency contraceptive that works best when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex, ideally within 24 to 72 hours. While no method is 100% effective, taking it promptly increases its effectiveness.

Some people may feel dizzy, have changes in their menstrual cycle, or experience symptoms like nausea or headaches. These side effects are usually temporary and should subside shortly. If the symptoms persist or you have any concerns, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.

07/02/2025, 10:18 - Honey AI Chatbot: When you are on any kind of method for family planning, such as the 2-3 month injection, it is common to experience changes in your menstrual cycle. You may have late or early menstruation, or even miss a period altogether, as it is one of the side effects. Since your pregnancy test result is negative, it's likely that the changes in your menstrual cycle are due to the injection. If you have further concerns or if the changes persist, it might be helpful to consult with a healthcare professional.

07/02/2025, 10:18 - Honey AI Chatbot: For long-term contraceptive options, you can consider either implants or the Lydia IUD. An implant is a small device inserted under the skin of the upper arm and works for 3 years. The Lydia IUD is a T or Y-shaped device inserted into the womb and can prevent pregnancy for 5 to 10 years. Both methods can be removed at any time if you decide to conceive in the future.

10/02/2025, 15:07 - Honey AI Chatbot: Lubricants, also called gels or lubes, are special fluids used during sex. They help reduce friction, discomfort, and dryness, making sex more pleasurable and preventing condoms from breaking. Lubricants come in water-based, silicone-based, or oil-based types. Water-based lubes are safe with all condoms, they don't change the vagina's pH, don't stain clothes, and wash off easily with water. Silicone and oil-based lubes should only be used with specific condom materials.

30/06/2025, 08:29 - Tobi Shalom: Daily pills
30/06/2025, 08:29 - Honey AI Chatbot: Daily pills are combined oral contraceptive pills for pregnancy prevention, dermatological and gynecological conditions, and management of menstrual irregularities (heavy bleeding, painful menstruation, premenstrual syndrome).

They work by making the sperm difficult to enter the womb.

Daily pills are either a 21-day pack (Dianofem and Desofem) or a 28-day pack (Levofem). 
One pill is taken each day at about the same time for 21 days. Depending on your pack, you will either have a 7-day break (as in the 21-day pack) or you will take the pill that contains Iron for 7 days (the 28-day pack).

30/06/2025, 08:29 - Tobi Shalom: Diaphragm
30/06/2025, 08:29 - Honey AI Chatbot: <Media omitted>
30/06/2025, 08:29 - Honey AI Chatbot: A diaphragm or cap is a barrier contraceptive device inserted into the vagina before sex to cover the cervix so that sperm can't get into the womb (uterus). You need to use spermicide with it (spermicides kill sperm). 

The diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6 hours after sex. The diaphragm is a vaginal barrier contraceptive that is woman-controlled, nonhormonal, and appropriate for women who cannot or do not want to use hormonal contraceptive methods, intrauterine devices, or condoms.
