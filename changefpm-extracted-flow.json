Some methods, like hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, or IUDs), may have side effects like changes in libido, mood swings, or dryness. However, these effects are not universal, and many individuals use contraceptives without experiencing negative impacts on their sex lives. Other non-hormonal methods like condoms or copper IUDs typically don't affect libido. Ultimately, it's essential to discuss any concerns or potential side effects with a healthcare provider to find the best option that suits your needs and lifestyle.nbsp",
