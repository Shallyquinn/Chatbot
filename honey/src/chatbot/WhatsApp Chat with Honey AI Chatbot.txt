What is your question?
23/01/2025, 20:32 - Tobi Shalom: Is there a permanent way to prevent pregnancy?
23/01/2025, 20:32 - Honey AI Chatbot: Yes, there are permanent family planning methods available. If you would like more information, please call 7790 for free.
23/01/2025, 20:33 - Tobi Shalom: How does family planning contribute to maternal health?
23/01/2025, 20:33 - Honey AI Chatbot: Family planning contributes significantly to maternal health by allowing women to space and limit pregnancies, which reduces the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. By preventing unintended pregnancies, family planning helps women avoid high-risk pregnancies and provides them with the opportunity to recover fully between pregnancies. Additionally, it empowers women to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, leading to better health outcomes for both mothers and their children.
23/01/2025, 20:35 - Tobi Shalom: How reliable is the withdrawal method?
23/01/2025, 20:35 - Honey AI Chatbot: The withdrawal method, also known as "pulling out," is not considered a highly reliable form of contraception. It requires the male partner to withdraw before ejaculation, which can be difficult to time perfectly. Even with perfect use, the withdrawal method has a failure rate of about 4%, meaning 4 out of 100 couples will experience an unintended pregnancy in a year. With typical use, the failure rate increases to around 22%. Therefore, it is less effective than other contraceptive methods, such as condoms or birth control pills.
23/01/2025, 20:36 - Tobi Shalom: Are there natural supplements to help with conception?
23/01/2025, 20:36 - Honey AI Chatbot: While there are no guaranteed natural supplements to aid conception, some people believe that certain vitamins and minerals can support reproductive health. For example, folic acid, vitamin D, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids are often recommended for their potential benefits in supporting fertility. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, as they can provide personalized advice based on your health needs.

What is your question?
23/01/2025, 20:37 - Tobi Shalom: How can I switch from pills to an IUD?
23/01/2025, 20:37 - Honey AI Chatbot: Switching from birth control pills to an IUD involves a few steps, and it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to ensure a smooth transition. Generally, you would schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your options and have the IUD inserted. The IUD can be inserted at any time during your menstrual cycle, but your doctor might recommend a specific timing to ensure continuous contraceptive coverage. Once the IUD is inserted, you can stop taking the pills. Your healthcare provider will guide you through the process and address any concerns you may have.

23/01/2025, 20:39 - Tobi Shalom: How I go know say the implant don expire?
23/01/2025, 20:39 - Honey AI Chatbot: Implants typically have a specific duration for which they are effective, usually up to three years. To know if your implant has expired, you should keep track of the date it was inserted and consult with your healthcare provider as you approach the end of its effective period. Your doctor can confirm if it's time for removal or replacement. Additionally, if you experience any changes or concerns, it's always a good idea to reach out to your healthcare provider for guidance.

What is your question?
23/01/2025, 20:40 - Tobi Shalom: If I wan carry bele, wetin I go do after stopping the pill?
23/01/2025, 20:40 - Honey AI Chatbot: If you want to conceive after stopping the birth control pill, it's generally recommended to allow some time for your menstrual cycle to return to its natural rhythm. This can vary for each person, but many women can conceive soon after stopping the pill. It's a good idea to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, and consider taking prenatal vitamins. If you have any concerns or it takes longer than expected to conceive, consulting with a healthcare provider can provide personalized advice and support.

What is your question?
23/01/2025, 20:41 - Tobi Shalom: Can contraceptives affect sexual desire?
23/01/2025, 20:41 - Honey AI Chatbot: Yes, contraceptives can sometimes affect sexual desire, although this varies from person to person. Hormonal contraceptives, like birth control pills, may lead to changes in libido for some individuals. However, others may not experience any change or might even notice an increase in desire due to reduced anxiety about unintended pregnancy. If you notice significant changes in your sexual desire after starting a contraceptive, it's a good idea to discuss this with a healthcare provider to explore other options that might better suit your needs.

What is your question?
23/01/2025, 20:42 - Tobi Shalom: Can I use multiple methods at the same time for extra protection?
23/01/2025, 20:42 - Honey AI Chatbot: Yes, using multiple methods of contraception simultaneously can provide extra protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This is often referred to as "dual protection." For example, combining a hormonal method like the pill with a barrier method like condoms can increase effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and also protect against STIs. It's important to choose methods that complement each other and suit your lifestyle and health needs. Consulting with a healthcare provider can help you make the best choice for your situation.

If the symptoms persist or you have any concerns, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.

07/02/2025, 10:18 - Tobi Shalom: I did family planning. I took the 2-3 month injection. But this is the first time that I took it. So, for this month, I've not retained my period and I test my decision. The result is negative. I'm confused
07/02/2025, 10:18 - Honey AI Chatbot: When you are on any kind of method for family planning, such as the 2-3 month injection, it is common to experience changes in your menstrual cycle. You may have late or early menstruation, or even miss a period altogether, as it is one of the side effects. Since your pregnancy test result is negative, it's likely that the changes in your menstrual cycle are due to the injection. If you have further concerns or if the changes persist, it might be helpful to consult with a healthcare professional.

07/02/2025, 10:18 - Honey AI Chatbot: For long-term contraceptive options, you can consider either implants or the Lydia IUD. An implant is a small device inserted under the skin of the upper arm and works for 3 years. The Lydia IUD is a T or Y-shaped device inserted into the womb and can prevent pregnancy for 5 to 10 years. Both methods can be removed at any time if you decide to conceive in the future.

For best results, it is recommended to take it immediately after sex. However, it is important to note that Postpill should not be taken more than three times in a month.

They help reduce friction, discomfort, and dryness, making sex more pleasurable and preventing condoms from breaking. Lubricants come in water-based, silicone-based, or oil-based types.

Silicone and oil-based lubes should only be used with specific condom materials.

They work by making the sperm difficult to enter the womb.

Daily pills are either a 21-day pack (Dianofem and Desofem) or a 28-day pack (Levofem). 
One pill is taken each day at about the same time for 21 days. Depending on your pack, you will either have a 7-day break (as in the 21-day pack) or you will take the pill that contains Iron for 7 days (the 28-day pack).

30/06/2025, 08:29 - Honey AI Chatbot: A diaphragm or cap is a barrier contraceptive device inserted into the vagina before sex to cover the cervix so that sperm can't get into the womb (uterus). You need to use spermicide with it (spermicides kill sperm). 

The diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6 hours after sex. The diaphragm is a vaginal barrier contraceptive that is woman-controlled, nonhormonal, and appropriate for women who cannot or do not want to use hormonal contraceptive methods, intrauterine devices, or condoms.

They help reduce friction, discomfort, and dryness, making sex more pleasurable and preventing condoms from breaking. Lubricants come in water-based, silicone-based, or oil-based types. Water-based lubes are safe with all condoms, they don't change the vagina's pH, don't stain clothes, and wash off easily with water. Silicone and oil-based lubes should only be used with specific condom materials.

One pill is taken each day at about the same time for 21 days. Depending on your pack, you will either have a 7-day break (as in the 21-day pack) or you will take the pill that contains Iron for 7 days (the 28-day pack).

It contains 75mg of the hormone Levonorgestrel in each rod. Jadelle implants are over 99% effective and can prevent pregnancy for a period of 5 years.

This method is completely and quickly reversible because it releases very low dose of hormone which leaves the body quickly when removed, so the woman can get pregnant without delay.
